Question 4: Good<p>
Question 5: Looks good<p>
Question 6: Good<p>
Question 7: Good<p>
Question 8: We worked a fair amount in class on interpreting the magnitude of model coefficients--you needed to say something about that here.<p>
Question 9: Missing residual map.<p>
Question 10: If you're rejecting the "null hypothesis of uniformity" what does that mean?<p>
Question 11: The R2 for this model isn't super high, and there is some issues with heteroskadesticity.<p>
<p>
General feedback: This is almost there (and I can tell your responses are brief). To be marked as complete, you need to address issues in questions 8-10.
